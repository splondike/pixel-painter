This project is a little puzzle game for the Rockbox open source music player firmware based off this: http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/453

Most of my remaining interest in this project is working on the computer's solving algorithm, trying to make it give as good an estimate as possible while remaining within the resource constraints of the device.
